🧠 Django DB Tool
A command-line utility for orchestrating a full data pipeline—download, transform, import, and export—for Django applications. 
This tool simplifies running management commands and provides feedback on data volume processed at each stage.

📦 Features
Interactive selection of data type (UserProfiles, Products, Carts)

Sequential execution of Django management commands:

download_<app>

transform_<app>

import_<app>

export_<app>

Automatic reporting of record counts from JSON output files

Friendly console messages with emoji indicators for clarity

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.6+

Django project with management commands for each pipeline stage

JSON output files generated by each command:

<app>_download.json

<app>_transformed.json

<app>_imported.json

<app>_exported.json

Installation
Clone or copy the script into your Django project directory.

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/django-db-tool.git
Or simply save the script as db_tool.py.

🛠 Usage
Run the script from your Django project root:

bash
python db_tool.py
Follow the interactive prompt to choose the data type:

Code
📦 What type of data would you like to process?
1. UserProfiles
2. Products
3. Carts
Enter choice (1-3):
The tool will then execute the full pipeline and display record counts for each stage.

📁 Output Files
Each stage expects a corresponding JSON file:

Stage	Expected File
Download	<app>_download.json
Transform	<app>_transformed.json
Import	<app>_imported.json
Export	<app>_exported.json
If a file is missing, the tool will skip the volume check for that stage.

🧩 Customization
To add support for more data types, update the data_map in choose_data_type():

python
data_map = {
    "1": "userprofiles",
    "2": "products",
    "3": "carts",
    "4": "orders"  # New type
}
Ensure corresponding management commands and JSON files exist for the new type.
